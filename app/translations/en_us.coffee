    gravitational_lensing: "Gravitational Lensing"
    lensing_text_1: "Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, made a remarkable prediction. Massive objects, such as stars, would bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths. Evidence for this revolutionary theory was first obtained by Arthur Eddington in 1919, when during a solar eclipse he observed that stars near the edge of the Sun appeared to be slightly out of position. The Sun was behaving like the lens in a magnifying glass and bending the light from the background stars!"
    lensing_text_2: "In 1937, Fritz Zwicky realized that massive galaxies (which can contain anywhere from ten million to a hundred trillion stars) or clusters of galaxies could be used to magnify distant galaxies that conventional telescopes couldn’t detect. As you can see, not unlike a conventional magnifying glass, these gravitational lenses not only magnify and focus the light of the distant background galaxies but they can, and mostly do, distort them as well."
    lensing_text_3: "When one of these gravitational lenses happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be up to x10 or even more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby."
    lensing_text_4: "Observations of the distorted background galaxy can also give us useful information about the object that is behaving as a gravitational lens. The separation and distortion of the lensed images can tell astronomers how much mass there is in the object, and how it is arranged. It’s one of the few ways we have of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is, how clumpy it is and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies. Knowing this can provide crucial information about how galaxies evolve."
    needles: "Needles in a Haystack"
    needles_text_1: "There is a lot of interesting science to be done with gravitational lenses. The problem is that they are very rare. Only about one in a thousand massive galaxies is aligned with a background object well enough to cause it to appear multiply-imaged. We currently know of about 400 objects that are behaving as gravitational lenses, largely because we have become very good at observing the night sky! Modern optical surveys cover thousands of square degrees, with images sharp and deep enough to resolve about 1 lens per square degree. There should be thousands of lenses that we can detect, but we will need to look at millions of galaxy images to find them!"
    needles_text_2: "The ideal solution would be to get a computer to look through all of the images, but unfortunately this is not a straightforward solution. Teaching a computer to recognize the effects of gravitational lensing is not too difficult, but they can be easily confused by galaxies that look very similar to a distorted background galaxy. Also in order for the computer to run fast enough to analyse lots of images quickly, they have to cut a lot of corners, and this makes them less effective."
    discovering: "Discovering Lenses: A Human-Computer Partnership"
    discovering_text: "Human beings have a remarkable ability to recognise patterns and detect the unusual with only minimal training. With a basic understanding of what the distorted images of galaxies that have passed through a gravitational lens look like, participants in the SpaceWarps project can help discover new examples of this amazing phenomenon, and enable our survey scientists to carry out new investigations of stars and dark matter in the universe. We will be doing two types of lens search. In our blind searches, we’ll be asking volunteers to spot signs of gravitational lensing in images of the sky taken as part of the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) legacy survey. This survey has been searched by computers, but we’re pretty sure they didn’t catch all the lenses to be found! These results will help us re-train the computers to do better on larger surveys in future. Then, in our targeted searches, in other upcoming sky surveys, we’ll be showing participants galaxies and groups of galaxies that our computers have selected as possibly being gravitational lenses. The task will then be to assess whether or not they actually are! In both cases, there will be confusing objects around - the challenge is to come up with the most plausible explanation for what is going on, in collaboration with the rest of the SpaceWarps community. Do you think you can spot outer space being warped? We do!"

    marshall_bio: "Phil is an astronomer at the University of Oxford Physics department. After deciding he liked doing maths and physics problems at school and university enough to want to make up his own questions, Phil did a PhD at Cambridge University on using gravitational lensing to map the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters. He then did several postdoctoral research jobs in California, using strong lenses to weigh galaxies, and investigating automated strong lens detection. He knows very well how hard it is to teach a robot to spot lenses - or at least, how hard it is to teach them not to be confused by large numbers of galaxies that are not lenses."
    verma_bio: "Aprajita is an astronomer at the University of Oxford, and previously worked at Imperial College London and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (Germany). She became fascinated by gravitational lenses during her PhD in which she studied some of the most luminous galaxies seen in the Universe, some of which have been gravitationally lensed. Aprajita is interested in making use of gravitational lenses as natural telescopes to study the galaxies that are being lensed in more detail than would normally be possible, as well as measuring the light and dark matter in the lensing galaxies themselves. Having worked with citizen scientists looking for gravitational lenses in Galaxy Zoo, she was inspired by their efforts, motivating the emergence of Space Warps."
    a_more_bio: "Anupreeta is a JSPS postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli IPMU in the University of Tokyo (Todai). She has been captivated by gravitational lenses ever since she first saw one. She likes to find these rare systems and study them to learn more about the mysterious dark matter and how it influences the galaxies hosted within. She's interested in developing better algorithms to find lens systems automatically in order to solve the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; problem. She’s leading the first Space Warps project using data from the CFHT Legacy Survey. With the help of citizen scientists, she can find the lenses that were missed by her arc-finding algorithm which will help her improve the algorithm. This will be extremely useful when doing lens searches with future large imaging surveys."
    baeten_bio: "Els has always been interested in science, and astronomy in particular, but choices and career moves steered her in a very different direction. So, when she discovered GalaxyZoo, it was the chance of a lifetime to get seriously involved. This resulted in, among other things, moderating the discussion in several different projects (Solar StormWatch, Old Weather, IceHunters and recently for GalaxyZoo Talk) and classifying in many more. Before GalaxyZoo came along she had only some vague notions of what a gravitational lens was, but she quickly became intrigued by them and spent hours searching the SDSS images for potential lenses. She is looking forward to doing some serious lens hunting!"
    cornen_bio: "Claude was an IT development manager and is now retired after a long professional life in the French consumer loan business. He could then take his time reading, learning history of sciences and attending lectures on astrophysical topics. In volunteering on Zooniverse projects , he uses his ability in data mining to respond to calls for &quot;wanted&quot; objects in the Galaxy Zoo forum like &quot;peas&quot;, &quot;overlaps&quot;, &quot;AGN with ionized clouds&quot;, and &quot;strong gravitational lenses.&quot;"
    faure_bio: "Cécile is a former researcher in gravitational lensing, mostly known for her work on the COSMOS lens catalog. She is now retired from research. Nowadays, she actively participates in projects of science for the public in France."
    fohlmeister_bio: "Janine is astrophysicist at the University of Heidelberg. Since her undergraduate study in physics she has been fascinated by strong gravitational lens systems, and studied the effect during her PhD. She specialized in observing brightness variations of distant lensed quasars, and measuring their time delays. She found that galaxy clusters have the power to delay the light travel times between the different images of a background quasar by up to several years."
    gill_bio: "Mandeep is an observational cosmologist working at SLAC (Stanford University), with a collaborator affiliation also at CBPF in Rio de Janeiro. Having done early undergrad research at NASA, he turned his attention “inward” for some time and did his graduate training as an experimental particle physicist. Being lured back by the stars (and galaxies), he then did postdoctoral research in gravitational lensing in both the weak and strong regimes, focussing on weighing and counting galaxy clusters with the ultimate aim of helping the worldwide effort to figure out just what is driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe. He is also a member of the Dark Energy Survey collaboration."
    thomas_j_bio: "Thomas has a long background in both business and astronomy; the latter has become his lifelong passion. He is currently studying astronomy-related physics and mathematics and has studied many other subjects including planetary science, meteorology and geology. Thomas enjoys discussing and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms, to help ‘newbies’ in particular. He is attracted to deep space astronomy and can often be found chewing over the subject of dark matter."
    kueng_bio: "After doing a Bachelor’s degree in physics, Rafael is a Master’s student in Computational Science at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at University of Zurich. He works with Prasenjit on the reconstruction of identified gravitational lenses. For his Master’s thesis, he is writing a tool for further modeling already identified gravitational lenses, based on Jonathan Coles’ simulation program."
    macmillan_bio: "Christine, a planetarium presenter, participates in citizen science, classifying in Galaxy Zoo and posting in the forum. She has always been fascinated by the sky, starting with the Moon when a small child, then the solar system and stars, and then learning about galaxies and gravitational lenses in a natural progression of expanding horizons."
    s_more_bio: "Surhud is a long-term postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli-IPMU in the University of Tokyo (Todai). He wants to use gravitational lensing to learn about the formation and evolution of galaxies and the cosmological parameters of the Universe. He is interested in building statistically meaningful samples of strong gravitational lensing systems to achieve these goals."
    saha_bio: "Prasenjit is an astrophysicist at the University of Zurich, and is especially interested in reconstructing lenses: that means using what is observable on the sky (or in your Space Warps browser window) to figure out just how warped the space around the lens is, where the dark matter in the lensing galaxy or cluster would be, and what it can tell us about the Universe at large."
    tecza_bio: "Matthias is an astronomer at the University of Oxford with a specialisation in astronomical instrumentation for large telescopes. In particular, the instruments he builds can be used to study galaxy dynamics, that is, determining how stars and gas move within galaxies. Gravitational lenses are ideal subjects for such studies, delivering data on the lensing galaxies and the lensed background galaxies simultaneously. Matthias is interested in comparing the mass of the lensing galaxies from his dynamical measurements to those obtained from gravitational lensing."
    wilcox_bio: "Julianne stumbled across Galaxy Zoo several years ago following a report on BBC. Having been an avid amateur astronomer since childhood, she found the London skies somewhat lacklustre. After realising classifying galaxies was an excellent way to get back into astronomy, she has gone on to participate in many projects. Although not from a science background, she has found the Zooniverse to be an excellent way of learning new concepts, while making a valid contribution to science. When not glued to her PC participating in citizen science, she can be found testing and analysing software systems."
    wright_bio: "Layne is an electrical engineer with a physics background who became interested in gravitational lensing while participating in the Galaxy Zoo project. His focus shifted from primarily hunting lenses to modeling them after realizing that almost any galaxy cluster could host lensing of the most &quot;beautiful complexity&quot;. Since then, he has been actively creating software to help visualize these more exotic, &quot;multi-plane&quot; lenses."

    borden_bio: "Kelly is an archaeologist by training but an educator by passion. While working at the Museum of Science and Industry and the Adler Planetarium she became an enthusiastic science educator eager to bring science to the masses. When not pondering the wonders of science, Kelly can often be found baking or spending time with her herd of cats – Murray, Ada, & Kepler."
    kapadia_bio: "Amit joined the Zooniverse team at the Adler Planetarium in September of 2011. He comes from a background of physics and mathematics. He has worked for various astronomy outreach groups including three of NASA's Great Observatories."

Before joining the Zooniverse team as Visual Designer, David worked for The Raindance Film Festival, the News 21 Initiative's Apart From War, Syracuse Magazine, and as a freelance designer for his small business, Miller Visual. David is a graduate of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, where he studied Visual & Interactive Communications."
    parrish_bio: "Michael has a degree in Computer Science and has been working with The Zooniverse for the past three years as a Software Developer. Aside from web development; new technologies, science, AI, reptiles, and coffee tend to occupy his attention."
    smith_bio: "As an undergraduate, Arfon studied Chemistry at the University of Sheffield before completing his Ph.D. in Astrochemistry at The University of Nottingham in 2006. He worked as a senior developer at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Human Genome Project) in Cambridge before joining the Galaxy Zoo team in Oxford. Over the past 3 years he has been responsible for leading the development of a platform for citizen science called Zooniverse. In August of 2011 he took up the position of Director of Citizen Science at the Adler Planetarium where he continues to lead the software and infrastructure development for the Zooniverse."

    lensed_galaxies_text_1: "In general, galaxies can be big (massive) or small (compact), with a clear shape or morphology (e.g. spiral and elliptical galaxies) or messy (e.g. irregular, clumpy and merging galaxies). As they are made up of many stars, galaxies generally appear to be extended in astronomical images, unlike single stars that just look like compact, round sources."
    lensed_galaxies_text_2: "Galaxies with lots of stars or mass can act as cosmic telescopes and bend light of a galaxy lying behind them into multiple images. Typically the most massive galaxies appear yellow-red in colour (the colour is indicative of old stars that are massive). They usually have a smooth distribution of light and are spherical or elliptical in shape. Similarly, the central bulges of large galaxies can be massive enough to cause lensing."
    lensed_galaxies_text_3: "When a distant galaxy (background source) is lensed by a galaxy lying between us and the galaxy, you can get multiple images of the galaxy that typically trace a circle around the lensing galaxy, see the examples below. The last example shows the case when the background source and the lensing galaxy almost exactly aligned along the of sight to us - this produces a lensed image that is a ring, usually referred to as an Einstein ring."
    lensed_galaxies_text_4: "If you look at the examples below you'll probably have already noticed that the lensed or distorted images tend to be blue rather than the yellow/red of the lensing galaxy. This is partly because more distant galaxies are more likely to be young and so they have a lot of young stars that predominantly create more energetic photons or blue light. In addition, distant galaxies are &quot;redshifted&quot; this means the light you actually see originated from a shorter or bluer wavelength. Hence distant galaxies tend to look blue. While this is typically true for most of the lenses you will see, if these objects are at very high redshift, it can be that the bright blue photons that are emitted are so far away that they actually arrive at earth at even longer wavelengths. These images will appear red in our colour composites. So don't reject red arcs or images - these could just be at high redshift!. There's an example of a high-redshift lensed quasar in lensed quasars."
    lensed_galaxies_text_5: "This faint blue galaxy is being magnified and distorted into an arc by the massive red galaxy. See how the arc curves around the lens. If you look closely there is a hint of a counter-image (a second image opposite side of the lens to the primary arc). It is the same colour as the primary arc but it is typically fainter. Because of this sometimes the counter image is bright enough to be seen but sometimes it's too faint to be seen."
    lensed_galaxies_text_6: "Very massive galaxies can cause multiple images to form. Here you see a blue arc and two additional blue images, these are arranged roughly on a circle around the lensing galaxy. This standard lens configuration is called the fold configuration."
    lensed_galaxies_text_7: "Very massive galaxies can cause multiple images to form, arranged roughly on a circle around themselves."
    lensed_galaxies_text_8: "In the very rare instance that a background galaxy is (almost perfectly) aligned to the foreground galaxy along the line of sight to us, the light of the background galaxy is deflected in all directions. This give rise to a ring-like lensed image and is called an Einstein Ring."
    lensed_galaxies_text_9: "Spiral galaxies are like fried eggs: the bulge of stars in the middle is the yolk, while the spiral arms lie in the thin layer of egg white. Imagine sticking two fried eggs to either side of a circle of cardboard, and then looking at the whole thing from the side. That's what an edge-on spiral galaxy looks like. These are not usually very massive but some of them can act as lenses. Above are some examples of how the edge-on lens systems look like."
    
    lensed_quasars_text_1: "Quasars or quasi-stellar objects are very compact galaxies that have very bright central regions that outshine the rest of the galaxy making it look &quot;star-like&quot;. The nucleus is so bright because it's massive and it's made up of millions of stars with a very massive black hole. As matter falls into the black hole it lights up making the nucleus very bright. When a compact object like a quasar is lensed by a galaxy that's lying between us and the quasar it is lensed into discrete multiple images like the examples shown below. Quasars are rare compared to galaxies and hence, lensed quasars are even rarer than lensed galaxies. Below the examples show quasars lensed by a single galaxy, quasars lensed by a galaxy group are even rarer. To date, only three quasars lensed by a galaxy group/cluster have been found."
    lensed_quasars_text_2: "This is a bright blue &quot;quasi-stellar object&quot; behind a massive galaxy: it has been lensed into two images, one on either side of the lens galaxy."
    lensed_quasars_text_3: "This quasar has been lensed into four images, arranged around the galaxy. This is called the Einstein cross configuration. Quads are about 6 times rarer than doubles."
    lensed_quasars_text_4: "This is a quasar at high redshift, so it appears yellow-ish. The image configuration in this case is a quad, with two images very close together."
    
    group_lenses_text_1: "Galaxy groups and clusters are gravitationally bound entities. They mark the most massive regions in the Universe. As such these are the most powerful cosmic telescopes and can produce large and spectacular arcs and multiple images. See the examples below."
    group_lenses_text_2: "Groups or clusters of massive red galaxies can lens background galaxies into long, bright arcs. These arcs are typically less curved and at larger separations from the lensing galaxies than would be seen for a single lensing galaxy. This is because groups and clusters of galaxies are much more massive than a single galaxy and so the deflection of the image (or separation) can be larger."
    group_lenses_text_3: "Groups and clusters of massive galaxies can form many images, often of more than one background galaxy. The bright images curve around the entire lens that can be several galaxies."
    
    rings_spirals: "Rings &amp; Spirals"
    loners: "Loners"
    lightweights: "Lightweights"
    mergers_neighbors: "Mergers &amp; Neighbors"
    
    rings_spirals_text_1: "Ring and Spiral galaxies are common galaxy types. These are not massive galaxies but are typically actively forming-stars and therefore the rings and arms look blue. Spiral arms are a common feature, such as found in our own Milky Way. Ring galaxies may be formed by the interaction of two star-forming galaxies. Depending on orientation, spiral arms and rings can look similar to gravitationally lensed images of a background galaxy, these are common false positives. Some tips on how to distinguish them from the real thing are below."
    rings_spirals_text_2: "These often have yellow &quot;bulges&quot; and blue &quot;spiral arms.&quot; Unlike arcs, the arms don't trace a rough circle around the bulge, and is usually accompanied by some fuzzy distribution of light."
    rings_spirals_text_3: "Their yellow bulges are surrounded by complete, oval rings of blue light. In contrast, Einstein Rings are typically more circular, and brighter."
    
    loners_text_1: "We have put a selection of objects that look like blue arcs in this page, however these are not gravitationally lensed systems. The easiest check is that there is no plausible massive gravitational lens in their vicinity. See below for some examples."
    loners_text_2: "Some faint blue galaxies appear arc-like. If there isn't a massive galaxy present, it's almost certainly not being lensed!"
    loners_text_3: "This example is very elongated, like a cluster arc - but there is no cluster of massive yellow galaxies present."
    loners_text_4: "Faint blue galaxies can appear in groups and clusters too, and sometimes the galaxies in those groups can look aligned in an arc shape so they look a bit like multiple lensed images - but with no lens!"
    
    lightweights_text_1: "As we described previously, a galaxy needs to be massive to act as a gravitational lens. Spiral and irregular galaxies are not massive enough to cause strong gravitational lensing usually. However, there are some known cases of spiral galaxies (both seen face-on and edge-on) acting as gravitational lenses. While thinking about whether you are seeing gravitational lensing it's worthwhile considering if the object you think is the lens is massive enough or is it a &quot;lightweight&quot;? Do you see any other evidence that might disfavor lensing e.g. the lensed images are too far or the arc is too straight? Here are some examples."
    lightweights_text_2: "Sometimes a yellow/red galaxy is present near a blue arc but its too small to create such a large or separated arc. The arc might appear too curved or curved in the wrong direction (it doesn't encircle the lensing galaxy). In the case above, the arc is too far away to be lensed by such a small galaxy."
    lightweights_text_3: "The most massive galaxies have bulges of yellow/red stars – bulgeless, blue galaxies usually don't have enough mass to strongly deflect light. Such galaxies are less likely to act as lenses."
    
    mergers_neighbors_text_1: "As you may have seen in Galaxy Zoo, galaxies are moving objects that sometime collide and interact. This produces a single more massive galaxy at the end, but as the interaction is very complex and slow, spiral arms and star forming regions from both of the merging galaxies can be tidally distorted and drawn out. Usually, these merging galaxies can be identified due to their similar colors since such galaxies have roughly similar stellar population and ages. Below we give an example of how such mergers can be mistaken to be a lensing galaxy. These arms & tidal tails can end up looking similar to long blue arcs seen in lensing around the central redder bulge of the merging galaxies. Below we give an example of how such mergers can be mistaken to be a lensing galaxy."
    mergers_neighbors_text_2: "Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies, that aren't physically associated to each other, but are simply next to each other can look like a lens. This is just a chance or random alignment of galaxies. For lensing candidates remember to look for an arc that is defined and curved around a plausible lensing galaxy, and also look for hints of a counter image. If things look very nebulous & fuzzy or curved the wrong way, it's most likely this isn't a lens. See the example below."
    mergers_neighbors_text_3: "Two galaxies merging together can look a bit like a lens system. Her two spiral galaxies appear to be merging with multiple arms and a fuzzy distribution of light. Sometimes mergers cause displaced arms, or tidal tails. Unlike arcs, the arms or tidal tails do not trace a circle around the red bulge."
    mergers_neighbors_text_4: "Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies can look a bit like a lens system. In these cases usually the supposed &quot;arc&quot; is not bright enough, it is not clearly defined or is fuzzy or the &quot;lens&quot; is not massive enough (as above)."
