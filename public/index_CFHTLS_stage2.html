            <h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>
            <p>Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, made a remarkable prediction. Massive objects, such as stars, would bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths. Evidence for this revolutionary theory was first obtained by Arthur Eddington in 1919, when during a solar eclipse he observed that stars near the edge of the Sun appeared to be slightly out of position. The Sun was behaving like the lens in a magnifying glass and bending the light from the background stars!</p>
          
            <p>In 1937,  Fritz Zwicky realized that massive galaxies (which can contain anywhere from ten million to a hundred trillion stars) or clusters of galaxies could be used to magnify distant galaxies that conventional telescopes couldn't detect.
            
            As you can see, not unlike a conventional magnifying glass, these gravitational lenses not only magnify and focus the light of the distant background galaxies but they can, and mostly do, distort them as well.</p>
          
            <p>When one of these gravitational lenses happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be up to x10 or even more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby.</p>
          
            <p>Observations of the distorted background galaxy can also give us useful information about the object that is behaving as a gravitational lens. The separation and distortion of the lensed images can tell astronomers how much mass there is in the object, and how it is arranged. It's one of the few ways we have of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is, how clumpy it is and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies. Knowing this can provide crucial information about how galaxies evolve.</p>
          
            <h2>Needles in a Haystack</h2>
            <p>There is a lot of interesting science to be done with gravitational lenses. The problem is that they are very rare. Only about one in a thousand massive galaxies is aligned with a background object well enough to cause it to appear multiply-imaged. We currently know of about 400 objects that are behaving as gravitational lenses, largely because we have become very good at observing the night sky! Modern optical surveys cover thousands of square degrees, with images sharp and deep enough to resolve about 1 lens per square degree. There should be thousands of lenses that we can detect, but we will need to look at millions of galaxy images to find them!</p>
          
            <p>The ideal solution would be to get a computer to look through all of the images, but unfortunately this is not a straightforward solution. Teaching a computer to recognize the effects of gravitational lensing is not too difficult, but they can be easily confused by galaxies that look very similar to a distorted background galaxy. Also in order for the computer to run fast enough to analyse lots of images quickly, they have to cut a lot of corners, and this makes them less effective.</p>

            <h2>Discovering Lenses: a Human-Computer Partnership</h2>
            <p>Human beings have a remarkable ability to recognise patterns and detect the unusual with only minimal training.  With a basic understanding of what the distorted images of galaxies that have passed through a gravitational lens look like, participants in the SpaceWarps project can help discover new examples of this amazing phenomenon, and enable our survey scientists to carry out new investigations of stars and dark matter  in the universe. We will be doing two types of lens search. In our blind searches, we'll be asking volunteers to spot signs of gravitational lensing in images of the sky taken as part of the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) legacy survey. This survey has been searched by computers, but we're pretty sure they didn't catch all the lenses to be found! These results will help us re-train the computers to do better on larger surveys in future. Then, in our targeted searches, in other upcoming sky surveys, we'll be showing participants galaxies and groups of galaxies that our computers have selected as possibly being gravitational lenses.  The task will then be to assess whether or not they actually are! In both cases, there will be confusing objects around - the challenge is to come up with the most plausible explanation for what is going on, in collaboration with the rest of the SpaceWarps community. Do you think you can spot outer space being warped?  We do!</p>
            
            <h2>Searching in Stages</h2>
            <p>Each lens search has two stages. In stage 1, we ask the community to "spot" gravitational lens systems, with some emphasis on completeness. At this stage, we don't want to miss anything interesting! If in doubt, mark it and discuss it in Talk. In stage 2, things are a little different: by this point, we'll have identified (together) several thousand lens candidates, and it's time to start narrowing down to identify the really promising ones. We want to reject the "false positives", and focus on the objects that really look like lenses. We use the same interface - just with a more critical eye. The goal is to assemble, together, a small list of very good lens candidates for the Science Team to follow up with big telescopes. And big telescope time is not cheap, so we're after the very best lens candidates!</p>

              <p>Aprajita is an astronomer at the University of Oxford, and previously worked at Imperial College London and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (Germany). She became fascinated by gravitational lenses during her PhD in which she studied some of the most luminous galaxies seen in the Universe, some of which have been gravitationally lensed. Aprajita is interested in making use of gravitational lenses as natural telescopes to study the galaxies that are being lensed in more detail than would normally be possible, as well as measuring the light and dark matter in the lensing galaxies themselves. Having worked with citizen scientists looking for gravitational lenses in Galaxy Zoo, she was inspired by their efforts, motivating the emergence of Space Warps.</p>

              <p>Anupreeta is a JSPS postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli IPMU in the University of Tokyo (Todai). She has been captivated by gravitational lenses ever since she first saw one. She likes to find these rare systems and study them to learn more about the mysterious dark matter and how it influences the galaxies hosted within. She's interested in developing better algorithms to find lens systems automatically in order to solve the "needle in a haystack" problem. She’s leading the first Space Warps project using data from the CFHT Legacy Survey. With the help of citizen scientists, she can find the lenses that were missed by her arc-finding algorithm which will help her improve the algorithm. This will be extremely useful when doing lens searches with future large imaging surveys.</p>

              <p>Els has always been interested in science, and astronomy in particular, but choices and career moves steered her in a very different direction. So, when she discovered GalaxyZoo, it was the chance of a lifetime to get seriously involved. This resulted in, among other things, moderating the discussion in several different projects (Solar StormWatch, Old Weather, IceHunters and recently for GalaxyZoo Talk) and classifying in many more. Before GalaxyZoo came along she had only some vague notions of what a gravitational lens was, but she quickly became intrigued by them and spent hours searching the SDSS images for potential lenses. She is looking forward to doing some serious lens hunting!</p>

              <section data-type="lensed-galaxies" class="show">
              <p>In general, galaxies can be big (massive) or small (compact), with a clear shape or morphology (e.g. spiral and elliptical galaxies) or messy (e.g. irregular, clumpy and merging galaxies). As they are made up of many stars, galaxies generally appear to be extended in astronomical images, unlike single stars that just look like compact, round sources.</p>

              <p>Galaxies with lots of stars or mass can act as cosmic telescopes and bend light of a galaxy lying behind them into multiple images. Typically the most massive galaxies appear yellow-red in colour (the colour is indicative of old stars that are massive). They usually have a smooth distribution of light and are spherical or elliptical in shape. Similarly, the central bulges of large galaxies can be massive enough to cause lensing.</p>

              <p>When a distant galaxy (background source) is lensed by a galaxy lying between us and the galaxy, you can get multiple images of the galaxy that typically trace a circle around the lensing galaxy, see the examples below. The last example shows the case when the background source and the lensing galaxy almost exactly aligned along the of sight to us - this produces a lensed image that is a ring, usually referred to as an Einstein ring.</p>

              <p>If you look at the examples below you'll probably have already noticed that the lensed or distorted images tend to be blue rather than the yellow/red of the lensing galaxy. This is partly because more distant galaxies are more likely to be young and so they have a lot of young stars that predominantly create more energetic photons or blue light. In addition, distant galaxies are "redshifted" this means the light you actually see originated from a shorter or bluer wavelength. Hence distant galaxies tend to look blue. While this is typically true for most of the lenses you will see, if these objects are at very high redshift, it can be that the bright blue photons that are emitted are so far away that they actually arrive at earth at even longer wavelengths. These images will appear red in our colour composites. So don't reject red arcs or images - these could just be at high redshift!. There's an example of a high-redshift lensed quasar in lensed quasars.</p>

              <p>This faint blue galaxy is being magnified and distorted into an arc by the massive red galaxy. See how the arc curves around the lens. If you look closely there is a hint of a counter-image (a second image opposite side of the lens to the primary arc). It is the same colour as the primary arc but it is typically fainter. Because of this sometimes the counter image is bright enough to be seen but sometimes it's too faint to be seen.</p>

              <p>Very massive galaxies can cause multiple images to form. Here you see a blue arc and two additional blue images, these are arranged roughly on a circle around the lensing galaxy. This standard lens configuration is called the <em>fold configuration</em>.</p>

              <p>In the very rare instance that a background galaxy is (almost perfectly) aligned to the foreground galaxy along the line of sight to us, the light of the background galaxy is deflected in all directions. This give rise to a ring-like lensed image and is called an Einstein Ring.</p>

              <p>Spiral galaxies are like fried eggs: the bulge of stars in the middle is the yolk, while the spiral arms lie in the thin layer of egg white. Imagine sticking two fried eggs to either side of a circle of cardboard, and then looking at the whole thing from the side. That's what an edge-on spiral galaxy looks like. These are not usually very massive but some of them can act as lenses. Above are some examples of how the edge-on lens systems look like.</p>

              <section data-type='lensed-quasars'>
              <p>Quasars or quasi-stellar objects are very compact galaxies that have very bright central regions that outshine the rest of the galaxy making it look "star-like". The nucleus is so bright because it's massive and it's made up of millions of stars with a very massive black hole. As matter falls into the black hole it lights up making the nucleus very bright. When a compact object like a quasar is lensed by a galaxy that's lying between us and the quasar it is lensed into discrete multiple images like the examples shown below. Quasars are rare compared to galaxies and hence, lensed quasars are even rarer than lensed galaxies. Below the examples show quasars lensed by a single galaxy, quasars lensed by a galaxy group are even rarer. To date, only three quasars lensed by a galaxy group/cluster have been found.</p>

              <p>This is a bright blue "quasi-stellar object" behind a massive galaxy: it has been lensed into two images, one on either side of the lens galaxy.</p>

              <p>This quasar has been lensed into four images, arranged around the galaxy. This is called the Einstein cross configuration. Quads are about 6 times rarer than doubles.</p>

              <p>This is a quasar at high redshift, so it appears yellow-ish. The image configuration in this case is a quad, with two images very close together.</p>

              <p>Galaxy groups and clusters are gravitationally bound entities. They mark the most massive regions in the Universe. As such these are the most powerful cosmic telescopes and can produce large and spectacular arcs and multiple images. See the examples below.</p>

              <p>Groups or clusters of massive red galaxies can lens background galaxies into long, bright arcs. These arcs are typically less curved and at larger separations from the lensing galaxies than would be seen for a single lensing galaxy. This is because groups and clusters of galaxies are much more massive than a single galaxy and so the deflection of the image (or separation) can be larger.

              <p>Groups and clusters of massive galaxies can form many images, often of more than one background galaxy. The bright images curve around the entire lens that can be several galaxies.</p>

                <p>Ring and Spiral galaxies are common galaxy types. These are not massive galaxies but are typically actively forming-stars and therefore the rings and arms look blue. Spiral arms are a common feature, such as found in our own Milky Way. Ring galaxies may be formed by the interaction of two star-forming galaxies. Depending on orientation, spiral arms and rings can look similar to gravitationally lensed images of a background galaxy, these are common false positives. Some tips on how to distinguish them from the real thing are below.</p>

                <p>These often have yellow "bulges" and blue "spiral arms." Unlike arcs, the arms don't trace a rough circle around the bulge, and is usually accompanied by some fuzzy distribution of light.</p>

                <p>Their yellow bulges are surrounded by complete, oval rings of blue light. In contrast, Einstein Rings are typically more circular, and brighter.</p>

                <p>We have put a selection of objects that look like blue arcs in this page, however these are not gravitationally lensed systems. The easiest check is that there is no plausible massive gravitational lens in their vicinity. See below for some examples.</p>
                <h2>Isolated Blue Irregular Galaxy</h2>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/loners/CFHTLS_050_8615_13075_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>Some faint blue galaxies appear arc-like. If there isn't a massive galaxy present, it's almost certainly not being lensed!</p>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/loners/CFHTLS_101_10091_10348_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>This example is very elongated, like a cluster arc - but there is no cluster of massive yellow galaxies present.</p>
                <h2>Blue Group</h2>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/loners/CFHTLS_110_1042_7688_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>Faint blue galaxies can appear in groups and clusters too, and sometimes the galaxies in those groups can look aligned in an arc shape so they look a bit like multiple lensed images - but with no lens!</p>

              <section data-type="lightweights">
                <p>As we described previously, a galaxy needs to be massive to act as a gravitational lens.
                Spiral and irregular galaxies are not massive enough to cause strong gravitational lensing usually. However, there are some known cases of spiral galaxies (both seen face-on and edge-on) acting as gravitational lenses.  While thinking about whether you are seeing gravitational lensing it's worthwhile considering if the object you think is the lens is massive enough or is it a "lightweight"? Do you see any other evidence that might disfavor lensing e.g. the lensed images are too far or the arc is too straight? Here are some examples.</p>
                <h2>Straight or Distant Arclets</h2>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/lightweights/CFHTLS_022_14405_13384_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>Sometimes a yellow/red galaxy is present near a blue arc but its too small to create such a large or separated arc. The arc might appear too curved or curved in the wrong direction (it doesn't encircle the lensing galaxy). In the case above, the arc is too far away to be lensed by such a small galaxy.</p>
                <h2>Bulgeless Blue Galaxies</h2>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/lightweights/CFHTLS_152_7089_17977_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>The most massive galaxies have bulges of yellow/red stars &ndash; bulgeless, blue galaxies usually don't have enough mass to strongly deflect light. Such galaxies are less likely to act as lenses.</p>
              </section>
            
              <section data-type="mergers-neighbors">
                <p>As you may have seen in <a href='http://www.galaxyzoo.org/'>Galaxy Zoo</a>, galaxies are moving objects that sometime collide and interact. This produces a single more massive galaxy at the end, but as the interaction is very complex and slow, spiral arms and star forming regions from both of the merging galaxies can be tidally distorted and drawn out. Usually, these merging galaxies can be identified due to their similar colors since such galaxies have roughly similar stellar population and ages. Below we give an example of how such mergers can be mistaken to be a lensing galaxy. These arms & tidal tails can end up looking similar to long blue arcs seen in lensing around the central redder bulge of the merging galaxies. Below we give an example of how such mergers can be mistaken to be a lensing galaxy.</p>
                <p>Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies, that aren't physically associated to each other, but are simply next to each other can look like a lens. This is just a chance or random alignment of galaxies. For lensing candidates remember to look for an arc that is defined and curved around a plausible lensing galaxy, and also look for hints of a counter image. If things look very nebulous & fuzzy or curved the wrong way, it's most likely this isn't a lens. See the example below.</p>
                <h2>Mergers</h2>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/spirals-rings/CFHTLS_001_1555_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>Two galaxies merging together can look a bit like a lens system. Her two spiral galaxies appear to be merging with multiple arms and a fuzzy distribution of light. Sometimes mergers cause displaced arms, or tidal tails. Unlike arcs, the arms or tidal tails do not trace a circle around the red bulge.</p>
                
                <h2>Neighbouring Galaxies</h2>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/lightweights/CFHTLS_084_6943_2087_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies can look a bit like a lens system. In these cases usually the supposed "arc" is not bright enough, it is not clearly defined or is fuzzy or the "lens" is not massive enough (as above).</p>

              <p class='q'>What is my main task?</p>
              <p class='a'>The main task for the current project is to inspect the images on the classification page, look for a gravitational lens and mark (at least) any one of the lensed images within a lens system in an image. Lens systems are rare. Most of the images won’t have any lenses, a few images will have a lens and in extremely rare cases, there might be more than one lens in an image. So, watch out!</p>
              
              <p class='q'>I marked a simulated lens but was told that I missed it. What’s the problem?</p>
              <p class='a'>We'd like you to mark any lensed object that you see i.e. you can mark one or all of the curved arcs, or multiple quasars. Sometimes the site will tell you that you missed a simulated lens, when you actually marked something nearby the lensed object, e.g. the marker might have been placed on the lens galaxy itself instead of the lensed features.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>What do I do if I see more than one lensed image per lens system?</p>
              <p class='a'>You should place a marker on at least one lensed feature that you see per lens system. If you see an arc, mark it and preferably, mark its counter-arc if you can see it. If you see a pair of quasars (compact objects) either side of a lensing galaxy, mark both of them preferably.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>When should I use the Quick Dashboard?</p>
              <p class='a'>Many lensed images are faint and very close to the bright yellow lensing galaxies. You can switch to the Quick Dashboard to play with different settings or zoom/pan to get a detailed view near the lensing galaxy and be more confident of not missing a faint lens.</p>
              <p class='q'>I missed a lens! How do I go back?</p>
              <p class='a'>The last image you saw is in your 'Recents' list, on your <a href="#/profile">Profile</a>. You can click on this image to take it to Talk, where you can tag it for other people to see, and discuss it with them.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>Can I delete my markers?</p>
              <p class='a'>Yes, if you click on one of your markers, a little cross should appear above it. If you click on this cross, the marker is deleted.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>Can I turn off the simulated lenses?</p>
              <p class='a'>We found that without the simulated lenses, we started to make mistakes. We don’t want to miss any lenses, so we thought it best to keep showing simulated lenses, just in case! As you do more classifications we will show you a smaller number of simulated lenses.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>Can I turn off the feedback messages?</p>
              <p class='a'>As with the simulated lenses, we found that without the messages, we also started to make mistakes. We don’t want to miss any lenses, so we thought it best to keep the messages turned on!</p>
              
              <p class='q'>The images are really small! Can I make them bigger?</p>
              <p class='a'>Yes. Click on the Quick Dashboard, and scroll with your mouse to zoom in. You can move around in the image by dragging it with your cursor.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>I found something interesting! What do I do?</p>
              <p class='a'>The markers are only for lensed features, but you can add any image, whether you think it has a lens in it or not, to your favourites using the button. This will appear in your favourites list on your profile page. You can then click on that image to take it to Talk, where you can discuss it with with other people.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>Sometimes a vertical/horizontal section of the image looks completely dark. why is that?</p>
              <p class='a'>Nothing to worry. These images are at the edges of the survey region where the telescope did not collect data. Since there’s no data, these sections look dark.</p>

              <p class='q'>What is a gravitational lens system?</p>
              <p class='a'>When a massive galaxy, or cluster of galaxies, sitting right in front of another, much more distant galaxy, the light from the background galaxy gets deflected and focused towards us by the warped space around the foreground galaxy. This is referred to as a gravitational lens system.</p>
              <p class='q'>What does a typical lens system look like?</p>
              <p class='a'>A typical lens system will show a massive lensing galaxy or a galaxy group surrounded by magnified and distorted multiple images of a background galaxy.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>What’s the difference between a lens(ing) galaxy and a lensed galaxy?</p>
              <p class='a'>A lens galaxy or a lensing galaxy is the foreground massive galaxy which warps the space around it and causes light to bend around it. A lensed galaxy is a distant background galaxy from which light rays emerge and get bent or deflected due to the lens galaxy before arriving on earth.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>Why are gravitational lens systems interesting?</p>
              <p class='a'>Gravitational lenses have a plethora of applications in astrophysics. Most importantly, they are used for understanding properties of Dark Matter which is very difficult to probe by other methods. Since lens systems also create magnified images of the distant background galaxies, we get a detailed view and hence, better understanding of these distant and faint galaxies which would be impossible otherwise. Other interesting applications include measuring the age of the Universe, finding exoplanets, etc.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>Why do you need my help to look for gravitational lenses?</p>
              <p class='a'>How a lens system will look like in the sky depends on several factors relating to properties of the foreground and the background object. There is enough complexity in these lens systems that the process of detection has not been fully automated till date. One of the major problems is contamination from lens-like systems e.g., spiral galaxies, ring galaxies and other artefacts in the images that mimic arc-like shapes. Human beings are better at processing and filtering objects that have multiple levels of complexities even if they are non-standard. Lens systems fall in this category and we need your help both in discovering newer types of lenses and building better algorithms.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>How do I know what’s a lens and what isn’t?</p>
              <p class='a'>We’ve put up some examples of lenses, and non-lenses, in the Spotter’s Guide. You can see these examples on the main classification page (on the pull-out tab on the right hand side), and you can click on them to read more about them in the Guide page. You can also go to <a href='http://talk.spacewarps.org/'>Talk</a> and see what other people have found.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>What are simulated lens systems?</p>
              <p class='a'>Simulated lens systems are computer generated images of gravitational lens systems using standard models for a foreground galaxy (or galaxy group) and a background galaxy (or a quasar). These simulated lenses are then added to the real images of the sky observed with a telescope.</p>
              
              <p class='q'>Why do the images have simulated lens systems?</p>
              <p class='a'>Lens systems come in a wide variety and Spotter’s Guide page can be used to show only typical examples of lenses. Hence, we use simulated lens system to provide further training for the users. Also, we want to do a comparison of human vs. robots (ie. automated lens finding codes) for which we need a large test sample. Adding a large sample of simulated lenses to the real data help us achieve such comparison.</p>
