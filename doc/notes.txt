# Reconfiguring SW website for CFHTLS stage 2. Need to run the site locally, to
# check appearance, performance etc. 
# 
# Follow Amit's instructions:
#
#     The readme should get you going. You need to install Node. 
#     Then from the project root directory, run
# 
#     npm install
#     hem server --includeCss

# Here's the contents of the README.md:

#     ## Setting up
# 
#         git clone git@github.com:zooniverse/Lens-Zoo.git
#         npm install .
# 
#     ## Starting local server
# 
#         hem server --includeCss
# 
#     ## Building subjects
# 
#         cd /path/to/ouroboros
#         rails r /path/to/spacewarps/data-import/builder.rb
# 
#     or to build against staging server
# 
#         RAILS_ENV=staging rails r /path/to/spacewarps/data-import/builder.rb
#         ssh ubuntu@dev.zooniverse.org
#         cd /rails/apps/ouroboros_staging/current
#         sudo -u www-data bundle exec rails c staging
# 
#         # Clear the redis cache
#         SpacewarpSubject.redis_set.destroy
# 
#         # Activate subjects
#         SpacewarpGroup.activate
# 
#     ## Building and deploying project
# 
#         ./build.rb


# OK, first need to make sure Node is installed and up to date. This package
# comes with homebrew, so it was enough to do:

#   brew update

# to get the latest version of node and npm. [I got homebrew some time ago,
# with:  ruby ~/software/homebrew.rb after downloading homebrew.rb from the 
# homebrew website.]

# Now run the node install command:

npm install .

# npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/spine/1.0.8
# npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/nib
# ...
# npm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/options/-/options-0.0.5.tgz
# npm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/commander/-/commander-0.6.1.tgz
# > ws@0.4.27 install /Users/pjm/public_html/SpaceWarps/Dev/node_modules/hem/node_modules/testacular/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/socket.io-client/node_modules/ws
# > (node-gyp rebuild 2> builderror.log) || (exit 0)
#   CXX(target) Release/obj.target/bufferutil/src/bufferutil.o
#   SOLINK_MODULE(target) Release/bufferutil.node
#   ...
# hem@0.2.9 node_modules/hem
# ├── watch@0.5.1
# ├── coffee-script@1.6.3
# ├── optimist@0.3.7 (wordwrap@0.0.2)
# ├── eco@1.1.0-rc-3 (strscan@1.0.1)
# ├── uglify-js@1.3.5
# ├── stylus@0.34.1 (debug@0.7.2, mkdirp@0.3.5, cssom@0.2.5)

# ├── strata@0.20.1 (strftime@0.4.6, bufferedstream@1.6.0, mime@1.2.3, markdown@0.3.1)
# ├── jade@0.33.0 (character-parser@1.0.2, mkdirp@0.3.5, commander@1.2.0, monocle@0.1.48, with@1.1.0, constantinople@1.0.1, transformers@2.0.1)
# └── testacular@0.4.0 (xmlbuilder@0.4.2, chokidar@0.6.2, glob@3.2.3, minimatch@0.2.12, socket.io@0.9.16)

# Done. This makes a directory called "node_modules". To do a hard reinstall, 
# \rm -rf this directory and redo the npm install .


# Now for the hem server - needs to be the right version!

sudo npm install hem@0.2.9 -g

# Start it up! The Css flag is important.

hem server --includeCss

# path.existsSync is now called `fs.existsSync`.
# >> Strata web server version 0.15.1 running on node 0.8.2
# >> Listening on 0.0.0.0:9294, CTRL+C to stop

# OK good! This terminal is now unusable, as the server is there listening in the
# background. Probably we could bg it, but its OK to just use a different term.

# Now - do we need to do the ouruboros stuff? Or can we just build?
# Try it:

./build.rb

# ./build.rb:5: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting $end
# AWS.config access_key_id: ENV['S3_ACCESS_ID'], secret_a...

# Looks like ruby script is expecting some Amazon passwords or something.
# Do we need this? Or can we run even more locally somehow, just for 
# site testing?

# Actually the build is not needed. All we need to do is point a browser at
# the following development server url:

#          http://0.0.0.0:9294/

# This works (with some help from Amit, fixing bugs at his end!)

# How to handle website reconfigurations?
# One branch per survey and stage? Or files stored per survey and stage?
# Or, one branch per survey, and keep separate files for stages?
#   This latter one has nice features: lots of PNG files needed for website
#   could be kept in separate branches. Stage 2 edits are minor, in principle
#   - so could be handled by 
# 
# Plan:
#
# * Fork Lens-Zoo repo to drphilmarshall              DONE
# * Make Aprajita and Anupreeta collaborators         DONE

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# A) Phil: over-write index.html (and other files) as needed:
#
# * Create dev branch to work in                      DONE
# * Keep copies of stage 1 html, eco files:           DONE
#     * public/index_CFHTLS_stage1.html               DONE
#     * app/views/classifier_CFHTLS_stage1.eco        DONE
#     * app/views/profile_subjects_CFHTLS_stage1.eco  DONE
# * Reconfigure the following files:
#     * public/index_CFHTLS_stage2.html               IN PROGRESS
#     * app/views/classifier_CFHTLS_stage2.eco        IN PROGRESS
#     * app/views/profile_subjects_CFHTLS_stage2.eco  IN PROGRESS
#     * others...
# * Write simple shell script to reconfigure website  DONE
# * Test local dev branch site using hem server       DONE
# * Merge in Zooniverse changes to master branch      ONGOING
# * When ready:
#     * Merge dev branch into master branch
#     * Submit pull request
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# B) Amit: since Sci Team changes are purely content, just change switches 
#    in index.coffee to point at different content!
# 
#    https://github.com/zooniverse/Lens-Zoo/blob/master/app/index.coffee
#
#    Need to learn how to do this...
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Required differences between Stage 1 and Stage 2:
#
# stage1.html, stage2.html with different spotters guides, labels etc.
# Different instant feedback... Different tutorial? Single pop-up? Doesn't
# have to be on particular image, can just come up on first visit to Stage 2.
# 
# Needs discussion.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# What about different projects in different branches?
#
# Potentially dangerous, if merging is not handled well... 
# Better to just flick switch in index.coffee in Amit's scheme. 
# 
# ie instead of having index.html, use CFHTLS.html, DES.html etc for content,
# and put images in
# 
# images/CFHTLS/guide, images/CFHTLS/tutorial
# 
# instead of images/guide/images/tutorial, etc.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Notes on git:
# 
# - Local master branch is to be kept a clean copy of the remote Zooniverse 
#   Lens-Zoo repo. Pull in Amit's edits using:
#   
# 
#   git checkout master   
#    (to move to the master branch of drphilmarshall/Lens-Zoo)
# 
#   git remote add upstream https://github.com/zooniverse/Lens-Zoo.git
#    (to connect yourself to the zooniverse version of the repo)
# 
#   git fetch upstream
#    (to get any new changes that Amit made, from zooniverse/Lens-Zoo)
# 
#   git merge upstream/master
#    (to merge in these new changes)
# 
# 
#   git checkout dev
#        (to return to your local dev branch)
#
#   git merge master
#        (to merge in changes from the master branch)
# 
#   git push origin dev
#        (to push committed changes in your local dev branch to the dev branch at https://github.com/drphilmarshall/Lens-Zoo)

# Split Spotter's Guide into separate file? Hmm. Not sure how this will work.
